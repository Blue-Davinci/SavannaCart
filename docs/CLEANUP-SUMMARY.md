# SavannaCart Project Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Security Hardening

### 🔒 Secrets Management
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded passwords from codebase
- ✅ Sanitized docker-compose.yml, main.go, values.yaml
- ✅ Updated .env.example with secure placeholders
- ✅ Enhanced .gitignore to prevent secret commits
- ✅ Deleted security-compromised script files
- ✅ Implemented secure sealed secrets workflow

### 📁 Project Organization
- ✅ Created proper directory structure:
  - `scripts/` - All automation scripts
  - `scripts/k8s/` - Kubernetes deployment scripts
  - `docs/` - All documentation files
- ✅ Moved PowerShell scripts to appropriate directories
- ✅ Cleaned up root directory of scattered files
- ✅ Organized Helm charts in `savannacart/`

### 🛠️ Development Experience
- ✅ Updated Makefile with comprehensive targets
- ✅ Added security scanning and validation targets
- ✅ Created development setup script (`scripts/setup-dev.sh`)
- ✅ Enhanced README with security best practices
- ✅ Added project structure documentation

### 🔍 Security Validation
```bash
make security/scan      # ✅ No hardcoded secrets found
make security/validate  # ✅ All security checks pass
```

### 🚀 Production Readiness
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts
- ✅ Sealed secrets for encrypted credential management
- ✅ NGINX ingress with SSL/TLS termination
- ✅ Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- ✅ Non-root container execution
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds

## 📋 Quick Start Commands
