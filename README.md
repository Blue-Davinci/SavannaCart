## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**SavannaCart** is a secure and scalable backend service built in Go for managing a product catalog, customer orders, and OpenID Connect-based authentication. Designed for Savannah Informatics, it supports hierarchical product categories of arbitrary depth, order processing, SMS/email notifications, and caching using Redis.

The goal is to simulate a real-world microservice that handles e-commerce-style workflows with best practices in authentication, containerization, and test-driven development.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

```
Go 1.21+
PostgreSQL 15+
Redis 6+
Docker & Docker Compose
Git
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/savannacart.git
cd savannacart
cp .env.example .env
```

Run migrations:

```
make migrate
```

Start Redis and PostgreSQL (if using docker-compose):

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Run the server:

```
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

### Unit tests

```
go test ./... -v
```

Tests cover:
- Token generation
- Authentication flow
- Redis caching logic
- Order creation handlers

### Linting

```
golangci-lint run
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- Authenticate users via OpenID Connect
- Submit or fetch products and their nested categories
- Place orders and get email/SMS confirmations
- Retrieve average product prices for any category recursively
- Secure all APIs with bearer token middleware

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

To deploy with Docker:

```
docker build -t savannacart .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env savannacart
```

Kubernetes manifests are located in the `/deploy/k8s` directory for deployment via Minikube or kind.
